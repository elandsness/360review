					<p>The results of your 360&deg feedback will be presented to you on a matrix called
                                        "The Achiever Model."  This model shows how your peers rate you on each of 12 personality
                                        traits with 6 of these persona being ideal traits.  The ideal traits are the ones that you see
                                        in the middle of the below example.  These are:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><strong>Entrepreneur:</strong> Having a high score in this area means that you excel at
                                            taking calculated risks and have an ability to inspire others to help you achieve your goals.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Competitor:</strong> The competitor works best when tasks are turned into competition.
                                            This individual strives to be great and works hard to win when there is a reward on the line.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Producer:</strong> Individuals who are high producers are great at getting things done.
                                            The producer is the person you turn to when you want something done and done right.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Stabilizer:</strong>The stabilizer is cool and calm under fire.  During a crisis
                                            this individual will keep their composure and be able to lead the team through the challenge.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Team Builder:</strong>A person who scores high on the team builder scale is able
                                            to assemble teams and get them working together even if the individual team members are not compatible.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Creator:</strong>The creator is an individual who is excellent at thinking outside the box.
                                            This person can think of creative ways to solve problems when others may just continue to do things
                                            how they have always been done.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>The 6 triangles on the perimeter of the chart represent the personality extremes.  When an individual
                                        exhibits too much of a behavior it crosses the line into the excessive.  Ideally these scores should be as low
                                        as possible.  The 6 extreme persona are:
                                        </p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><strong>Performer:</strong> When a person is overly entrepreneurial they cross into performer
                                            territory.  This person needs to be the center of attention and shows off excessively.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Attacker:</strong> An individual who is too competitive becomes an attacker.  The
                                            attacker must win at all costs.  Attackers are argumentative and will overly criticize others.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Commander:</strong> The commander is someone who becomes too much of a producer.  They
                                            will do anything to accomplish their goals, and become very narrow focused because of that.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Avoider:</strong> If a person exhibits too much of the stabilizer persona, they become
                                            an avoider.  The avoider stays away from conflict and will only make safe decisions in line with
                                            what has been done in the past.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Pleaser:</strong>An individual who has too much of the team builder trait is a pleaser.
                                            This person will do anything to make others happy.  The pleaser puts others ahead of themselves to a fault.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Drifter:</strong>The drifter is someone who possesses too much of the creator persona.  This
                                            person spends all of their time thinking of far fetched ideas and doesn't accomplish anything concrete.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>When looking at your results, you will see that each triangle in the matrix has a score.  This represents your
                                        score for each persona based on the feedback that you received.  The small number under your score is the difference
                                        between what you rated yourself and the score that your peers gave you.  Large discrepancies represent blind
                                        spots - when you have a more positive view of yourself than your peers do - and hidden strengths - when you
                                        have a more negative view of yourself than what your peers do.  It is important to note any large gaps, and the report
                                        will highlight these items in red for you.  If you have any large scores in the extreme traits, look at the positive
                                        trait that is a polar opposite (e.g. Attacker's opposite is Team Builder and Drifter's opposite is Producer) and
                                        work on improving your score there.  If you improve the opposite, the extreme trait will in turn get lower.</p>
